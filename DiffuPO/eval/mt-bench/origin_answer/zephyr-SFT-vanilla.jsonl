Here are some of the key differences between them:\n\n1. Curvature: Euclidean geometry assumes that the space is flat or straight. All the measurements made in Euclidean space are always the same, regardless of where they are taken. In contrast, Riemannian geometry allows for curvature, which means that the space can be curved or bent. This allows for more complex measurements and calculations.\n\n2. Applications: Euclidean geometry is used in many practical applications, such as architecture, engineering, and physics. It is particularly useful for describing the properties of flat surfaces, such as walls and floors. Riemannian geometry, on the other hand, is used in more theoretical fields, such as physics, astronomy, and mathematics. It is used to describe the properties of curved or curved spaces, such as the surface of planets or the curvature of the universe.\n\n3.
